## Getting Started

  You need the following tools installed in order to run this project:
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Node.js + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), and [Postbird](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/postbird).


1. Fork this repository and clone it into the current directory

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rnd18/divinaReceita.git
   ```


2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```


3. Set up the database

   ```bash
   psql -U <username> -c "CREATE DATABASE divinaReceita"
   psql -U <username> -d DivinaReceita -f DivinaReceita.sql
   ```

   You can manually import the DivinaReceita.sql to Postbird, remember to create a new database with the name DivinaReceita.

   ```bash
   Important!
   You have to alter the db.js, located in src/config to match your PostgreSQL settings.    
   You also have to alter the mailer.js, located in src/lib to match your Mailtrap settings.  
   ```

4. Populate it with Faker.js
   ```bash
   node seed.js
   ```
   ```bash
   Important!
   Every Faker user password is "pass" and every single one of them have administrator status.   
   ```


5. Fire up the server and watch files

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
